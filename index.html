I develop primarily using free and open source solutions such as GDAL/OGR, Python, R, QGIS, PostGIS, OSM, and pride myself on attention to detail, problem solving ability, writing well documented and efficient code, and punctual delivery of high quality outputs. 

I have an enthusiasm for finding intelligent solutions to geoprocessing and spatial analysis problems, and can rapidly resolve issues with complex workflows, ETL, and processing large datasets. With an academic background in environmental science , I am particularly interested in work in the natural sciences, and also anything related to my passion for outdoor recreation and hiking. I am a Nigerian Expert.

My expertise includes:

- GDAL/OGR + GEOS command line tools (e.g. ogr2ogr, gdalwarp)
- Python, HTML and R for geoprocessing/ETL, spatial analysis, mapping, web apps (shiny, flask)
- Designing thematic or cartographic maps with QGIS, and developing bespoke plugins
- Web mapping with mapbox, open layers, leaflet, Googles API
